Learning Path Suggestions 📚
If I were learning React Native, I'd recommend this progression:
1. Start with Search → teaches basic user input
2. Add Favorites → teaches data persistence  
3. Implement Dark Mode → teaches global state
4. Add Animations → teaches performance concepts
5. Build Team Builder → teaches complex interactions
Which of these interests you most? Or do you have a specific concept you want to learn (like animations, storage, navigation, etc.)? I can provide detailed implementation plans for any of them! 🚀
